# Dead Simple Modal

:bangbang: This branch is a retooling of the original modal tutorial for Ember 2.0 (beta). Be aware that there are breaking changes! A new tut is being written to go along.

This repo contains code from my tutorial: [A Dead-Simple Ember-CLI Modal](http://blog.atmartin.io/a-dead-simple-ember-cli-modal/). Feel free to jump through the link and follow along! 

###Installation
